twitterd
========

A really minature twitter notification demon, sparked from a IRC conversation.

###How To Use:

* The script will crash first time round because you havn't set a key up to use.
* I'm not allowed to share API keys so go make one at dev.twitter.com.
* Edit the config file found in /home/username/.config/twitterd.json (Put all 4 keys in there)
* Set this script to start up with your libnotify enabled desktop environment (GNOME3,Unity,Xfce etc)
* Profit? (If not, issue it)

###Notes

This is a very very small and bad way to make a twitter client
but for someone like me with minimal needs it works out great.
I'm not doing a huge amount to this project, especially not during 2014
so you might as well hack it to support your own features.

Also its MIT licence so hack away, although I wouldn't mind a mention :).
